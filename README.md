## Needs of this project

- Domain knowledge
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical inferencing
- writeup/reporting


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [Raw Data](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are :  
* Task-1 Outlier Detection
* Task-2 (pre processing)
4. Analysis is carried out in:
* Task 2 Accounting Seasonality
* Task 3 Comapring prices
* Task 4 Flagset highest price Fluctuation 

5. Running the files in that order will do the trick.
